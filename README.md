# Description  

I have refactored this site to improve the html and css to make it more readable and follow proper practices. My motivation to do so was to make the code follow html semantic structure, add alt attributes to images and various other alterations that had to be made.



## Changes made - HTML


-Added a meta tag for the view port to make the webpage more accessible across multiple devices and screen sizes.

-Added a more descriptive title for the webpage.

-Changed all the div elements to correct semantic html elements.

-Added alt tags to the images.

-Fixed a broken link that wasn't linking to the intended target

## Changes made - CSS

-Fixed multiple missing quotient marks on font attributes

-Removed multiple styles that I condensed into the same class to reduce clutter.

-Renamed multiple classes with more appropriate names

-Removed classes with no use

## Installation

No installation required.


## Usage 

The usage is very simple, the only interaction apart from opening the page is the 3 links in the top navigation bar. These are clicked and take you to the relevant sections of the page.
